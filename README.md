# Java Fundamentals - My Learning Journey

Welcome! This repository documents my progress through the **Java Fundamentals** course by Matt Thornfield. I'll be working through each topic covered in the course and organizing my code and exercises into folders by topic.

## Course Topics I'll Be Covering

Each topic will have its own folder in this repository, containing code examples, exercises, and notes. Here’s a breakdown of the topics:

1. **Getting Started**  
   Setting up my environment and writing my first Java program.

2. **Variables and Data Types**  
   Exploring primitive data types, Booleans, characters, arrays, and basic arithmetic.

3. **Control Flow**  
   Working with `if` statements, loops, and other flow-control tools.

4. **Strings and String Manipulation**  

5. **Code Structure**  
   Learning to organize code effectively, and working with classes.

6. **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**  
   Diving into inheritance, polymorphism, and interfaces.

7. **Collections**  
   Practicing with lists, sets, maps, and other data structures in Java.

8. **Exceptions and Error Handling**  

9. **Lambda Expressions and Functional Programming**

10. **Unit Testing with JUnit**  
    Writing tests to ensure my code works as expected.

11. **File I/O and Database Integration**  
    Managing files and connecting Java to databases.

12. **Deployment and Build Tools**  
    Using Maven for dependency management and application building.

## Tools and Setup

- **Java Development Kit (JDK)**: I’m using JDK 8 or higher.
- **IDE**: Coding primarily in IntelliJ IDEA or Eclipse.
- **Maven**: For managing dependencies and builds, as needed.
